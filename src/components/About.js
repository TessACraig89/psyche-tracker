        Psyche Tracker is for tracking and analyzing the patterns in oneâ€™s emotional, mental, and physical health in order to fuel personal growth. Users are able to create logs containing a date, ratings for various attributes, and comments. My motivation for developing Psyche Tracker was that I noticed positive results when I used a spreadsheet mirroring this concept for my own self improvement.</p>
